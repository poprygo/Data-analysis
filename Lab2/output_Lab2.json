How do you account for team members of different skill levels? (We are all seniors, but some specialize in BGP, or firewalls, or MPLS, etc.)?<\/p> <p>My position evolved into a QA\/QI role. I see opportunities for checklists, but I want to target the problem areas, then figure out how to get my team using them -- especially in a crisis.

I set the backup router to redistribute the default route only if installed and set metrics on both routers that made the failover have about 5 seconds down time. I also have vrrp across a bridge between the two routers so that my publics IP's are only active on 1 router at a time.<\/p> <p>I was told that this method is terrible and that I should put the ospf for those routers on top of vrrp and make both machines ospf identical.

However, HR staff and IT administrators, who are on the front lines of managing the merger of people and technology, will tell you this integration is a key factor in a smooth transition. Starting with onboarding employees \u2013 and the added fun of remote working \u2013 it quickly becomes apparent that a newly merged organization faces a messy stew of mismatched platform architectures and endpoint operating systems. Since IT can't hit the pause button, organizations must find a means of securely integrating their end-user computing environment with these new endpoint entries \u2013 and do so with minimal disruption.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">IT teams and HR are, more than likely, facing another year of healthy M&amp;A activity.

Putting in place a few best practices can save countless hours of staff time and provide the newly merged workforce with a productive work environment. Here are some to consider:<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Know your assets: <\/span><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Standardization starts with knowledge. IT needs a thorough inventory of platforms, critical applications, and devices the merged entities are using. It likely will include a mix of disparate endpoint hardware from different vendors, each of which has its own flavor of OS (including Windows 7, Windows 10, Windows Embedded, multiple Linux distributions, or MacOS).<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">With more devices in play in the remote environment, IT also needs to obtain a clear assessment of employees' expectations. No doubt, those working from home will prefer to make as few changes as possible in terms of the devices they use. They may even prefer to use a personal (non-business asset) device. Having knowledge of what applications and secure access need to be delivered on those devices is essential to a smoothly functioning merger.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Adopt a user mindset: <\/span><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The most powerful integration will come from viewing all changes through the lens of the employee\/user. At the endpoint, employees from Company A or Company B will expect easy, quick access to all the familiar tools they need to be productive. That requires looking at an endpoint operating system and management software that will deliver a consistent user profile regardless of where the employee is working that day and what device they\u2019re using.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Power up your operating system (OS):<\/span><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"> Organizations across industry sectors are coming to realize the answer is not to be found in keeping Windows at the edge and refreshing legacy hardware, but in placing Windows where it belongs \u2013 in the data center or cloud \u2013 and using a software-driven endpoint management solution to deploy the latest user experience technology quickly and economically across the merged enterprise. Critical to this is making sure the merged organization is using the very latest virtualization client software from Citrix, Microsoft, or VMware, as well as the latest unified communications tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx, or GoToMeeting.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">An OS that supports this modernization will be able to provide easy, secure access to virtualized applications, desktops, and cloud workspaces. It all ties back to taking the point-of-view of the user and executing a virtualized environment that can support remote working and a cloud-centric compute environment.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Be platform agnostic: <\/span><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Historically, most companies evolved to having one, or maybe two, platforms in place to manage and control their people's endpoint device usage. With the recent surge in year-over-year M&amp;A activity, however, it is not unusual for an organization to end up with three, four, or even more platforms focused on managing user endpoint devices from multiple hardware and software providers. The result is a cumbersome and costly mix of disparate endpoint hardware and operating systems, as well as multiple, isolated endpoint management platforms that cannot be integrated.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Therefore, companies deploying a platform-independent vehicle for unifying endpoint management and control will be far ahead of the game when having to integrate applications and devices from another entity. Rapid integration of different endpoint devices and operating systems can be possible if the endpoint solution is able to support the merged organization\u2019s ecosystem of partner technologies quickly and easily.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Taking the messiness out of mergers<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Integrating technology from often somewhat disparate entities can occur without extreme disruption. By beginning with a solid knowledge base of all assets involved and putting into place an inherently secure endpoint operating system, organizations will benefit from easy endpoint management and control.

    "summary": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I have not liked describing 5G as a \u201crace\u201d between nations.\u00a0 Therefore, I run a risk by using the following comparison: \u00a0Among the leading countries in 5G deployment, the USA was the first to define and allocate millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, and we are the last to allocate mid-band spectrum. The C-band auction (3.7-4.2GHz), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiercewireless.com\/regulatory\/c-band-clock-phase-auction-tops-charts-80-9b\" target=\"_blank\">which netted $80.9 billion<\/a>, is the USA\u2019s first foray into exclusive licensing in the mid-band spectrum for commercial wireless. This marked the highest-grossing spectrum auction ever in the U.S.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">This comes two years after the 3.5GHz auctions concluded in South Korea and over 18 months after their first NR commercial launch. What is the significance of this? How do we expect this to impact 5G in the USA?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I must first address the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) fans who will challenge my opening lines. I have stated for years as a 5G program manager at Keysight that shared spectrum (between technologies and between commercial entities) is inevitable and essential. I admire the CBRS experiment given small-geography licensing and co-primary use. \u00a0However, it has always felt just like that - an <i>experiment<\/i>. Bands are a maximum of 10MHz, newcomers must take second priority to the US military, license terms are only ten years (only after a fight to get them increased beyond three), and re-farming transition plans for incumbents extend to the better part of a decade. Therefore, I see CBRS as usable in specialized applications (e.g., Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)), more so than for general enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) models of today\u2019s mainstream 5G rollouts. The operative word is \"shared\" or \"co-primary.\" \u00a0Commercial operators dislike shared spectrum. \u00a0Given the state of the art of our mobile wireless systems, they lose control of the customer experience.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Europe, Korea, Japan, and China all have exclusive mid-band spectrum licensing to provide greenfield territory for 5G deployments.\u00a0 This new spectrum comes at a price. Propagation loss is higher, so cell-sizes are smaller (more base stations (gNodeB (gNB\u2019s)), associated link-budgets are tougher (more complex and expensive gNB\u2019s), and the state of the components and circuits for 3.5-4GHz applications is less mature (more expensive). <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Why it matters<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The addition of the new frequency band also means a more challenging regulatory environment; this is especially the case in Europe, given increased electromagnetic energy in many locations that are already at their legal limit. \u00a0However, this mid-band is new to commercial mobile wireless, and thus, the license holders do not have to force 5G to compete with a legacy radio interface in the same band. This simplifies deployment, especially given the other challenges of deploying in this new band.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">While T-Mobile deployed 5G in the low-band using their 600MHz spectrum, the other large operators in the US were constrained to using 3GPP\u2019s version of DSS (Dynamic Spectrum Sharing LTE and New Radio (NR) in the same channel) to establish nation-wide coverage of 5G NR. Indeed, Verizon launched in mid-October this year.\u00a0 I enjoy watching the associated DSS headlines with a mix of:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Promotion coming from vendors who have implemented and deployed DSS<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Positive announcements from operators who have launched 5G as a result<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Disdain coming from operators who claim not to need it<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Recent headlines indicating early frustration with a troubling decrease in system performance, given the unavoidable overhead with this technology. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">DSS is brilliant because, for now, there are too few 5G user equipment (UE) devices to make efficient use of the greenfield 5G spectrum. But it also means that neither LTE nor NR can make full use of each technologies' specific designs for maximal use of that spectrum.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Thus, we have the need for exclusive mid-band licenses\u2014especially in the USA. This latest move by the FCC is more than welcome. This also comes at an interesting cost. The mobile industry (auction winners) must also fund the compression of the current satellite use from the entire 500MHz of this band into the upper 200MHz. This is a cost estimated by the FCC at $3-5B with an \"incentive\" of up to $9.7B, if they transition within three years (the <\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.fcc.gov\/public\/attachments\/FCC-20-22A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">R&amp;O from the FCC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"> from March 2020 is worthwhile, if lengthy, read for the curious).\u00a0 This will further constrain the growing and intriguing satellite business. This is coming not only at a time of significant advancement in satellite and launch technologies but also of 3GPP's embracing of non-terrestrial network technology Rel-17 and beyond. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I cannot claim to understand the satellite business, so I remain unclear on its impact. But this move will result in a significant upgrade for mobile wireless in the USA. Notwithstanding the challenges of compressing satellite usage (which will include replacing some satellites), deploying lots of small cells (easements, local zoning, backhaul), making massive MIMO work efficiently (expensive and power-hungry gNB\u2019s), and deploying adequate numbers of C-band-capable UE\u2019s, the new spectrum is just what the doctor ordered for us. One of the most interesting parts of any FCC R&amp;O is in the final pages. This is where the commissioners express personal views on the decision. The FCC is more political than technical, and the associated tensions become palpable in reading these statements. At least two commissioners dissented with this 250-page decision.\u00a0 However, the dissent was constrained to implementation and legal specifics. No one disagreed with the need to dedicate more mid-band spectrum to 5G.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">From a selfish perspective, this is a benefit, and for me, it is exciting. The expanded use-models of radio spectrum have impacted a large part of my career since starting fresh out of school in 1985. We remain enthusiastic about the 5G opportunity and look forward to being a key part of making every band from 600MHz to 71GHz work to its utmost for the sake of a society with better communications.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><i><span style=\"color: black;\">Roger Nichols is 5G Program Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.keysight.com\/us\/en\/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keysight Technologies<\/a>.<\/span><\/i><\/p>",

    "summary": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Internet access, like electricity, has become a life necessity. While food, shelter, and water are critical for survival, connectivity is crucial for communication, information, education, and income. A longstanding issue in the telecommunications industry, the digital divide has plagued rural and remote areas, but in the wake of the pandemic, it has taken the national spotlight as many struggle to work and learn from home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Despite various programs and initiatives, particularly in recent months, progress has continued to be stalled to generate true, high-speed (or any speed) accessibility in these areas.

In rural areas, nearly one-fourth of the population \u2014 14.5 million people \u2014 lack access. With little hope for meaningful progress in the near future, some have taken matters into their own hands to develop creative solutions to bridge this divide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">How did we get here?<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The answer is two-fold. First, we don't have a sufficient broadband infrastructure in the U.S., particularly in less populated and lower-income areas. Many places lack the physical framework (underground conduits, utility poles) that makes it possible to easily build out fiber connectivity. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Second, even in areas with a strong infrastructure in place for fiber cables to be expanded, <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">an internet provider still needs interconnection points to connect to the internet. Connecting its local fiber build-out can be done via a telecom carrier hotel, but these are often located far outside smaller local communities. So even where fiber is laid in these rural areas, there are significant challenges to connect back to the internet.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Ultimately, as most things often do, the issue boils down to economics. Low population density means a larger area to cover, and thus, high capital costs. With fewer potential subscribers reached by a fiber rollout, the build-out infrastructure price per subscriber is also much higher, often making the ROI too low to implement without government or state subsidies. But despite various subsidy programs over the years, the problem persists. Often, subsidies have been given to the incumbent providers who have under-supplied these areas. Perhaps it is time for a new framework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">A New Standard <\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">With a new FCC leading the charge in 2021, we can look at what a new framework might entail. In a perfect world, it should rely on some new principles:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Public funds should be spent on publically-owned enabling infrastructure, sometimes called \"Layer Zero\" this includes utility poles, conduits, points of entry, ROWs, and more.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Access to public layer zero infrastructures should be made to private ISPs on an open access, non-discriminatory basis.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Local governments should look to provide dark fiber or lit fiber as needed, where the private marketplace is insufficient.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.benton.org\/publications\/public-infrastructureprivate-service\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a><span style=\"color: black;\"> published by the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society, titled \"<\/span><span style=\"color: #211e1e;\"> Public Infrastructure\/Private Service: A Shared-Risk Partnership Model for 21st Century Broadband Infrastructure,<\/span><span style=\"color: black;\">\" outlines this type of framework as a way to <\/span>enable innovation and to avoid lock into a single provider.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">In a best-case scenario, multiple private ISPs would compete to provide services to customers that functions of governments are often ill-equipped to do. This approach not only generates a smarter, broader market in which local ISPs and wireless ISPs can offer competitive services but could greatly increase accessibility. WISPs essentially extend the reach of the fiber infrastructure through airwaves, so having fiber pushed further out offers greater overall connectivity for an area. Recently, the FCC freed up additional spectrum to boost this capability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Additionally, Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites are poised to come online in the next few months, a new option for remote broadband connectivity. Satellites, by definition, circumvent the terrestrial obstacles of topology and distance.

A great example of creativity in expanding fiber networking capabilities recently came from American Tower. It began using the ground space at existing tower locations to help enterprises build distributed data centers in remote and rural areas. By placing containers where there already was connectivity, electrical power, and dark fiber assets, it created distributed edge-data centers that could host local compute and CDN resources. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The CDN functionality enables streaming of high-bandwidth content \u2013 everything from Netflix and YouTube to Zoom video classes and meetings - to serve populations in remote areas without buffering issues.

    "summary": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">When it comes to the networking industry, many of the same challenges are still vexing network engineers and slowing down network progress. To ensure growth, we must appreciate these challenges' depth and realize this well runs very deep. Here I discuss the nature of, and solution to, network automation today from a network engineer's perspective - and perhaps a way out of the well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">What network engineers are facing<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">Some of the main challenges network engineers must deal with include:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b>Network fragmentation: <\/b>No two networks are the same. No two micro slices of the same network are the same. This poses risks and difficulties when there is a need to touch the network. New technology outpaces engineers, and it seems that hype replaces considered decision making when leadership makes purchases that affect the network.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b>Inherent tribal knowledge: <\/b>The granularity of understanding a network is directly proportional to the length of time an individual has spent working in it. Transfer of this knowledge is, at the best of times, inconsistent and incomplete. The result is inefficient training, which leads to fewer successful new entrants into the space.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b>Perception of a closed culture: <\/b>Often, network engineering is subject to exclusive cliques and a secret club mentality. It can be dismissed by leadership as unimportant organizational overhead until \"something breaks.\" The roles within are not seen as desirable (or even attainable) by new entrants into the field. This generates a feedback loop between those outside the daily operation of complex networks and those within.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">What network engineers can offer the industry<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Addressing these challenges can be daunting. Fortunately, network engineers have lots to offer, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b>Historical perspective: <\/b>So many network engineers grew up with these networks. There was little formal training that fit the skill sets required, so companies and user groups devised their own. The people who operate networks are more often some of the same people who built them from scratch. This deep level of understanding and ownership is an unmitigated strength.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b>Easier to get started: <\/b>The learning curve to become a proficient Network Engineer has become smaller. With the introduction of certifications from vendors and resources provided by the \"old-timers,\" it is now easier than ever to start learning networking. Motivated individuals can tinker on their own at home as the similar protocols and equipment are nearly ubiquitous. And with the advent of cloud infrastructure, virtual environments can be stood up to practice your skills.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b>The role is changing: <\/b>People are also seeing that network engineering is more than just CLI commands in proprietary equipment. Network engineers develop complex software, manage versioning, and investigate complicated and subtle behaviors within these unimaginably intricate networks. The tools available and the skills required are changing to a higher layer of abstraction. Network engineers are more architects and provisioners while also developing and sourcing. This will attract an ever more diverse and able new workforce.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Approaching the Future<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">As network complexity increases and user expectations for performance, availability, and security grow, network engineers will need solutions to help them do their work more efficiently. Some of the common tools used today may need to be replaced or integrated into high-level systems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">For example, we cannot get rid of our most vaunted scripts. That one shell script that you wrote at 2 am on a Saturday three months ago to solve a DNS name parsing issue, or the monolithic beast, that was written by a mystic sage many years ago and now \"just works,\" are both integral to your network. Nor can we deny the benefit of using a vendor's own tool suite to solve certain workflow and communication issues.\u00a0 Open-source tooling will also continue to play a part. These current approaches may seem like impossible hurdles to true unified automation, but they are not. They also aren't the only solution to an ever-shifting and fragmented network architecture.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">We need a platform<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">We need a tool that can aggregate scripts, run Ansible Playbooks, Modules, and Roles, utilize REST APIs provided by vendors, and add custom functionality where needed in a low\/no-code manner. This addresses fragmentation by being agnostic to existing infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">This tool should also organize the disparate areas of work that network engineers do. It should catalog the automations achieved, thereby allowing a smooth knowledge handoff and common reference. Fostering the development of automation in a safe mock environment by experienced network gurus will help train the next generation at minimal risk to the network and document complexity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">A platform should also be reactive to the needs of the network and the business, as well as provide valuable insight into how the network can be improved. Newly introduced technology should benefit our network's landscape, not a hindrance to improving automation and network management.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\">We need to accept that networks are only going to get more complex and more interdependent with an organization's technology stack. Network engineers must demonstrate how much value they can bring to any organization and the future of operating and managing networks that drive business outcomes.

Edge computing is one of these technologies. While not necessarily new, we\u2019re just now starting to see how edge computing \u2013 the move from centralized data centers or cloud areas to more distributed computing that's closer to the source of the data \u2013 is becoming a key tool for certain industries. And rightfully so. Edge computing has the power to dramatically accelerate innovation in these sectors. But for organizations to experience the full benefits of the edge, they\u2019ll need to understand the role advanced technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) play in introducing disruptive new use cases. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>5G is the next-generation iteration of mobile communications that will allow much lower latency and higher throughput for wireless services, improving greatly on its predecessors. 5G is also ushering in other changes in mobile networks, including cloud-native software-driven components and open interfaces all of the way down to the radio network (RAN). All of this new technology comes with more complexity, but mobile operators can\u2019t afford to increase the cost of operating their networks to deal with this complexity. That\u2019s where AI comes in. AI is critical to the success of 5G and edge computing by enabling self-monitoring capabilities that ensure high quality and low latency of service. While neither of these technologies may be new to the business tech stack, they've never been more relevant or critical to what enterprises need right now.

On its own, 5G\u2019s capabilities allow for increased speeds; however, when combined with AI, entirely new opportunities are opened up. AI-based applications can react in near real-time to data being generated from 5G networks, giving way to an entirely new frontier of possibilities for automation. And for 5G, the automated capabilities of AI are critical. 5G networks are more complex than their predecessors and need consistent monitoring to ensure they are functioning at optimal levels. This observance cannot be completely owned by humans, as it requires around the clock management to guarantee the network is optimized and running well. Leveraging AI for automated monitoring capabilities does just that, helping to manage not only 5G networks but also control cost; as such, many service providers will adopt AI to build networks that can self-manage and self-heal.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The impact of 5G on AI <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">5G\u2019s capabilities to provide higher bandwidth and lower latency open up many new opportunities for AI applications.

When a user asks Siri or Alexa a question, there is a small lag in the response due to the technology\u2019s need to travel to the cloud center to process the request and identify the answer. This short delay might be fine when asking casual questions. What the weather is, who won last night\u2019s baseball game, or otherwise? But these seconds can be critical in more urgent cases that require a response in milliseconds. When combined with the capabilities of 5G networks, AI applications will be able to work smarter, faster.

Manufacturing is one that elicits the most promise in terms of being transformed by advanced tech. The sector is on track toward being completely automated, leveraging AI to ensure it\u2019s acting and reacting intelligently, without human intervention. But it will also need 5G; not only for the reduced latency requirements but also to facilitate edge computing adoption. Edge computing usage in manufacturing will allow the necessary data being disseminated across the network to live as close to each machine as possible so that it's being accurately relayed in real time. Industrial equipment will be able to work intelligently and autonomously, with the ultimate goal of all aspects of production being managed autonomously. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">On the less critical side, 5G and AI will allow for enhanced experiences for gamers. Gamers are a committed group, and every millisecond of latency can alter or ruin their experience, especially as technologies such as augmented reality are introduced. They need the advanced speed and connectivity that 5G can provide and the ability for the self-management of the network that AI drives. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced enterprises to recalibrate and reconsider every aspect of business and how they're managing product development, which innovation strategies are successful, and what tools to incorporate into their tech stacks. With the economy in flux and the marketplace growing increasingly competitive, enterprises need to strongly consider how they\u2019ll gain an edge as they navigate the new normal. Now is the right time to adopt the new technologies that will completely transform our industries.

    "summary": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">There has long been a universal understanding amongst online video gamers that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lag\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">lag kills<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">. A quick search of just that term nets more than 5.7 million results. More accurately, <i>latency <\/i>kills - your game experience, your character, and sometimes your ability to play at all. Gamers have adopted the term \"ping,\" per the utility, to describe rage-inducing latency. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download;jsessionid=36F932ECD9494D517BFB215BD6419411?doi=10.1.1.177.8852&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Academic papers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"> have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/56375431.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">long sought to solve<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"> the problem. Players invest heavily in hardware that promises better network performance, leading Netgear to see a good return on its \"pro gaming\" line of wireless access points. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Yes, I do have one, why do you ask? <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Early on, lag was due primarily to the centralization of gaming \"servers\" and less than optimal player connectivity options. As we all know, distance matters to packet performance, and gaming companies had one and only one data center from which to operate these online games. And the speed and bandwidth available from your local Internet provider can be the deciding factor in the ability to play online in a real-time, multi-player game.\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Cloud brought some relief. With more than one data center, gaming companies like Epic Games launched into the cloud. With multiple data centers around the globe, the gaming behemoth operates multiple game regions. These regions generally map to AWS data centers. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Which still leaves a whole lot of Fortnite's 250 million players trying to win a game despite \"really bad ping.\" <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">One might immediately think a multi-cloud approach would provide some relief. A quick search of a global map pinpointing the location of major cloud providers shows much better coverage but not nearly enough distribution. Large data centers need power and people, and connectivity, which leads most cloud data centers to be built near or in very large urban centers. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">That leaves huge swaths of the world suffering significant latency simply due to distance. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Edge extends beyond CDN <\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">We've watched over the past few years as Edge has begun to emerge as a more distributed, if smaller, data center strategy in which providers and enterprises can extend their presence to more of the world. That's the good news. The bad news is that most of the Edge offerings to date are an extension of existing content delivery network (CDN) offerings, whose infrastructure was designed and built to improve delivery and security of content. Neither addresses the need to optimize the real-time exchange of data required to successfully operate and play the type of sub-second response today's games require. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Assuming <i>that <\/i>obstacle could be surpassed, the issue of offering a truly multi-cloud platform remains problematic. Such a platform would need to embrace any cloud or edge data center seamlessly. That is, they'd have to be able to take advantage of compute anywhere to standup new instances of a \"server\" as close as possible to the players. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Obviously, such a multi-cloud, application-oriented platform would be ideal for more than just games. An exploding market for \"smart\" everything \u2013 from lights to garage doors to locks to my fish-tank \u2013 requires immediate responses to the telemetry they report. The ability to collect, analyze, and provide a response in near-real-time (latency must be less than 20ms) is increasingly important to many of the basic functions of our lives. Consider the growing responsibility we give sensors in our cars and the movement toward enabling our cars to make decisions based on real-time data about every other car we encounter. Even 20ms in some scenarios seems like a lifetime. \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Devices today have no more tolerance for slow responses than we do. Performance comes first, and we expect technology to provide it. But just as important is security. The more we delegate to applications the responsibility for managing our finances, our homes, and our businesses, the more important it becomes to secure them and the data they rely on. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Where Edge is going <\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The emerging Edge will converge around applications and the need for speed, portability, analytics, and security. Our answer to the challenge of physical distance has always been to close the physical gap between the application and its user. When apps were mostly made of content, using a distributed caching service made sense. But today's applications are not static. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The applications we need to perform and respond quickly are interactive and thus dynamic. They are the apps that manage dosing supplements to my reef tank on a scheduled basis. They manage the temperature in our homes and warn control systems about equipment conditions that could be dangerous to operators. They entertain us if they perform well. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Many apps today are a combination of cloud-hosted control applications with distributed data collection and processing applications. A growing percentage of them are <b>containerized<\/b>. All of them are built with components sourced from multiple providers, many of which must be loaded in real-time. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The emerging Edge is designed to eliminate these constraints. By recognizing that this not only a digital world but a multi-cloud one, this new Edge promises to enable true portability of applications across any environment along with the services they need to operate safely, securely, and at speed. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">And maybe - just maybe \u2013 the emerging Edge will finally eliminate the gamer's nemesis, lag, and fix my digital gaming experience. \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Of course, if it did, then I'd have no excuse for losing.\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>",

    "summary": "<p>Next year, if I have the money for it, I want to get a dedicated server (either from Hetzner or OVH) and some IPs (maybe like 16 IPs). The server will have Proxmox and VMs will get their network connection through a pfSense VM (some servers that don't need their own public IP will be behind a normal NAT using the pfSense WAN IP, and then 1:1 NAT for those that need a public IP). I wanted to see if I could figure out how to set this up now, just so I know what to do for when I get the server.<\/p>\n\n<p>So I set up some VMs in VirtualBox.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Network\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.ndt3.top\/i\/fb6b2b.jpeg\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The idea with this setup was that pfSense-01 would be like the hosting provider having some IPs (in this case a \/25) and are routing a \/28 to me. Ubuntu-03 would be a server on their network (I set it up to test if 1:1 NAT was working; it has a web server which returns the IP address of each request).<\/p>\n\n<p>But there's an issue:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ubuntu-01 can ping ubuntu-02 on both IPs<\/li>\n<li>ubuntu-02 can ping ubuntu-01<\/li>\n<li>ubuntu-01 and ubuntu-02 can ping pfSense-01 and pfSense-02<\/li>\n<li>pfSense-01 can ping ubuntu-02 on the 1:1 NAT IP<\/li>\n<li>ubuntu-01 can ping ubuntu-03<\/li>\n<li><strong>All good until here, but here's where the issue is:<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>ubuntu-02 cannot ping ubuntu-03<\/li>\n<li>ubuntu-03 cannot ping ubuntu-02 on the 1:1 NAT IP<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>All VMs can access the internet. I've been managing pfSense through ubuntu-01, which is a desktop VM.<\/p>\n\n<p>I read online about NAT reflection, so have set the following settings in an attempt to fix this issue:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>NAT reflection mode: Pure NAT<\/li>\n<li>NAT reflection for 1:1 NAT: checked<\/li>\n<li>Enable automatic outbound NAT for reflection: checked<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>All interfaces have the block private and bogon networks option unchecked.<\/p>\n\n<p>The firewall is as open as it can be, with both WAN and LAN being set to allow connections from any source to any destination. This will be changed to more secure settings once I get 1:1 NAT working.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I access the web server on ubuntu-03 from ubuntu-01, it works.\n<img alt=\"it works\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.ndt3.top\/i\/02f599.png\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>But trying to access that same page from ubuntu-02 (the one with 1:1 NAT) fails<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>nicholis@testnet-ubuntu-02:~$ curl -v --connect-timeout 10 http:\/\/10.33.19.137:8080\n* Rebuilt URL to: http:\/\/10.33.19.137:8080\/\n*   Trying 10.33.19.137...\n* TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connection timed out after 10000 milliseconds\n* stopped the pause stream!\n* Closing connection 0\ncurl: (28) Connection timed out after 10000 milliseconds\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>I asked the owner of a hosting company for help in fixing this (as they also use pfSense for their network) and he wasn't able to figure out why 1:1 NAT doesn't work in my setup.<\/p>\n\n<p>So now I'm asking here: how do I get 1:1 NAT working?<\/p>",
